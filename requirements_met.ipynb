    "\n",
    "A great deal of work has been done by AGDC partners to outline the key requirements and technical approach for the next version of the AGDC (Version 2). For example, the previous Technical Working Group held a workshop that resulted in a draft Preliminary Design Report that has subsequently been translated to the AGDC wiki ( http://datacube.org.au ). Similarly, prototype functionality has been built to test and verify key concepts for a range of components including the netCDF-4 based Storage Units that are managed under NCIfs NERDIP data management, publishing and general access to data protocols; a Generalised Data Framework (GDF) to access the multidimensional Storage Units; and the AGDC Analytic Engine adding support for interactive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following requirements for Version 2 have been mainly based off this thinking and documentation. It is important to note that these requirements are for the current development\n",
    "effort running through till June 30, 2016. They are designed to guide and define the next step in the development of the AGDC, not as the final destination.\n"
